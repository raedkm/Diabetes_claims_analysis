### 1.4 Project Overview
This report demonstrates how a `modular analytics pipeline` improves data science workflows in an enterprise setting. The project focuses on analyzing a diabetes claims dataset, with tasks like data extraction, cleaning, feature engineering, model development, and deployment being handled independently by specialized teams.

In contrast to traditional siloed approaches, the modular pipeline enables parallelization, reducing bottlenecks and fostering efficient collaboration. The central component of this pipeline is a `feature store`, where engineered features are stored and made accessible for quick model development and deployment.
The pipeline includes the following stages:

- Data Extraction: Automated extraction from various sources like databases, APIs, and live events.
- Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, validation, and initial EDA.
- Feature Engineering: Creation of features stored in the `feature store` for future use.
- Modeling and Reporting: Teams extract data from the `feature store`, build models, and perform hypothesis testing.
- Model Deployment & Monitoring: Final model deployment for generating predictive insights and supporting decision-making.

## 3. Preprocessing Steps
### 3.1 Data Ingestion
<!-- ![Age Distribution](age_distribution.png) -->
The raw layer ingests CSV files while enforcing schema validation. This ensures that each column maintains the correct data type, preventing inconsistencies in downstream processing. The data is then converted to Parquet format for storage efficiency and type preservation.

**_Schema Validation and Column Standardization_**

To ensure data integrity, the ingestion process applies:
- Explicit data type enforcement using a predefined dictionary.
- Column renaming for consistency across analysis stages.	
- Initial data validation to verify data types and structure.

```python
# Define the data types for each column in the dataset
dtype_dict = {
    "MEMBER_CODE": "int64",    # De-identified member ID, stored as float to match dataset format
    "Age": "int64",             # Age of the member
    "GENDER": "category",       # Gender is a categorical variable
    "POLICY_NO": "int64",       # Policy number, stored as integer
    "CMS_Score": "int64",       # Charlson comorbidity index score, stored as integer
    "ICD_CODE": "category",     # ICD-10 codes are categorical
    "ICD_desc": "string",       # ICD-10 description as a string
    "City": "string",           # City as a string, handling missing values separately
    "CLAIM_TYPE": "category",   # Claim type is categorical
    "BMI": "float64"            # BMI as a float
}

# Column renaming lookup table
column_lookup = {
    "MEMBER_CODE": "member_code",
    "Age": "age",
    "GENDER": "gender",
    "POLICY_NO": "policy_number",
    "CMS_Score": "cms_score",
    "ICD_CODE": "icd_code",
    "ICD_desc": "icd_description",
    "City": "city",
    "CLAIM_TYPE": "claim_type",
    "BMI": "bmi"
}
# Load the dataset with specified data types
raw_data = pd.read_csv(raw_data_path, dtype=dtype_dict)

```

**_Conversion to Parquet for Type Preservation_**
After schema validation, the dataset is saved in `Parquet format` to maintain column types across different processing layers:

### 3.2 Data Cleaning
- The average age of patients is {df['Age'].mean():.2f} years.
- The dataset contains {df.shape[0]} rows and {df.shape[1]} columns.

To ensure data consistency and integrity, a series of data cleaning steps were performed, including handling missing values, identifying and removing duplicates, and validating the dataset.

**1. Identifying Missing Data**

A summary of missing values was generated to assess completeness. The city column was identified as having 4,700 missing values, while other critical fields remained largely intact.

**2. Handling Missing Data**

The missing values in the city column were replaced with "Unknown" to retain records without introducing bias. Other imputation strategies, such as mean or mode imputation, were considered but were not required at this stage.

**3. Checking for Duplicates**

Duplicate records were reviewed to prevent redundant information.

- Duplicate rows found: 2, which were removed.
- The claim_type column exhibited duplication where records with an 'I' value had an identical counterpart with an 'O' value.
  - 34,233 out of 34,235 records with claim_type = I had an identical entry with claim_type = O.
  - These inconsistencies were flagged for further review and correction in subsequent processing stages.

**4. Data Validation**

Following the cleaning steps, a final validation was conducted to confirm:

- No remaining missing values in critical columns.
- No duplicate rows affecting dataset integrity.
- Flagging of claim_type anomalies for further processing.

This ensures the dataset is now structured, consistent, and ready for transformation in the next stage.

### 3.3 Data Transformation
Following data cleaning, data transformation ensures consistency, usability, and alignment with downstream analytical processes. Key transformations include converting categorical values into structured indicators and standardizing textual information.

**3.3.1. Converting Claim Type into an Indicator**

The claim_type column contained duplicate records where 'I' (initial claim) and 'O' (other claim) values represented the same entry.
- A transformation function was applied to convert the 'I' value into an indicator column, ensuring unique records while preserving relevant information.
- Duplicate rows arising from this transformation were removed to prevent redundancy.

**3.3.2. Normalization Process: Standardizing City Names**

City names were standardized to ensure consistency for analysis:

- Addressed variations in formatting, capitalization, and spelling.
- Examples:
  - Trimming whitespace (e.g., " RIYADH " → "RIYADH").
  - Converting to title case (e.g., "RIYADH" → "Riyadh").
  - Correcting hyphenation (e.g., "'AL-AHASA" → "Al-Ahasa").
A lookup table was created for reusable standardized city names.

### 3.4 Data Quality checks
To ensure the dataset maintains logical consistency and accuracy, a series of data validation checks were conducted. These checks included logical value constraints, member data consistency assessments, and ICD code standardization. Any identified issues were documented for further analysis.

**3.4.1. Logical Value Checks**

Key numerical and categorical variables were validated against predefined logical ranges:
- age: Ensured all values fell within a plausible range (0–120 years).
- bmi: Confirmed all BMI values were within a reasonable range (10–80).
- gender: Ensured only expected categorical values ("M" or "F") were present.

*Suggestions: How will you handle outliers or incorrect values*

**3.4.2. Identifying Family Units Using member_code**

Some member_code values are linked to individuals of different ages and genders, suggesting that member_code may represent family units rather than individual identifiers. For example, the same member_code appears for both male and female individuals of varying ages, indicating family-level grouping within policies. A unique identifier for individuals is created in the feature engineering section.

**3.4.3. Correct code mapping**

An ICD-10 lookup table was created for icd_code and icd_description to:

- Identify duplicate or conflicting mappings.
- Ensure consistency in ICD-10 codes across records.
- Detect missing or mismatched descriptions requiring correction.

**3.4.4. Intermediate Quality Report & Documentation**

All flagged quality issues were documented and saved for further analysis. This included:

- Entries with out-of-range values (e.g., unrealistic BMI or age values).
- Household-based member_code groupings for further validation.
- ICD code standardization inconsistencies.

A summary of member_code groupings was saved in non_unique_member_codes.csv for further verification and future analytical segmentation.

## 4. Feature Engineering & Feature Store

### 4.1 Overview of Data Transformations & Feature Engineering
This section outlines the structured process of transforming raw data into analytical features, ensuring consistency, standardization, and usability for downstream modeling and analysis. The approach follows a layered transformation method, converting raw attributes into structured feature tables.
Note: Feature engineering is an iterative process that evolves based on exploratory analysis. While this report presents feature creation before descriptive analytics for clarity, the actual process involved analyzing data gaps, transforming variables, and iterating based on insights.

### 4.2 Key Data Transformations & Feature Creation


***4.2.1 Creating Unique Identifiers***

To ensure accurate individual tracking while preserving privacy, a unique identifier was created by combining:
- policy_number
- member_code
- age
- gender

This identifier allows differentiation of individuals within the same policy while enabling household-level analysis.

***4.2.2 Numerical to Categorical Transformations***

To enhance interpretability and improve modeling performance, numerical variables were categorized into meaningful groups:

| Feature                  | Categories                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Age Group (age_group)** | 10-year intervals (e.g., 0-9, 10-19, 20-29, …, 80+) |
| **BMI Category (bmi_cat)** | - Underweight (<18.5) <br> - Healthy (18.5–24.9) <br> - Overweight (25–29.9) <br> - Obese (≥30) |
| **Obesity Class (obesity_cat)** | - Class 1 (30–34.9) <br> - Class 2 (35–39.9) <br> - Class 3 (≥40) |


These categorizations allow for comparative risk analysis across different patient groups.

***4.2.3 Standardizing City Names***

To ensure consistency in geographic analysis, city names were normalized by:
- Trimming whitespace to remove unwanted spaces.
- Converting names to title case (e.g., "RIYADH" → "Riyadh").
- Correcting hyphenation inconsistencies (e.g., "Al Khobar" → "Al-Khobar").
- Creating a lookup table to store standardized city names for reusability.
Additionally, a "Major City" feature was introduced, categorizing cities based on the top 5 cities by unique patient count.

***4.2.4. Converting claim_type into an Indicator and removing duplicates***

A transformation was applied to the claim_type variable to convert ‘I’ values into an indicator while handling duplicate rows:
- ‘I’ (Initial Claim) was transformed into a binary indicator variable.
- Duplicate entries caused by claim_type variations were identified and removed to ensure data integrity.

### 4.3 Extracting Feature Tables

To enhance data accessibility, key feature tables were created for streamlined analysis:

| Feature Table               | Description                                                        |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Diabetes Type Table**      | Aggregates diabetes classification based on ICD-10 codes per unique identifier. |
| **Comorbidity Table**        | Stores Charlson Comorbidity Index scores per unique identifier.  |
| **Diabetes Feature Table**   | Captures diabetes-specific indicators, including treatment intensity. |
| **Family Size Table**        | Groups members under the same policy to determine household size. |
| **Unique Identifier Table**  | Stores transformed IDs for downstream merging and validation.    |
| **ICD-1 Lookup Table**       | A lookup table to stode the ICD-10 descriptions.    |

### 4.4 Storing Features for Reuse
- Engineered features were saved in structured feature tables to facilitate efficient retrieval, reuse, and analysis.
- Outputs were stored in a feature store using Parquet format for optimized storage and column type consistency.

*Suggestions: Explain how feature tables will be used in subsequent analysis*

Feature tables will be used to streamline the modeling process by providing pre-processed, consistent, and reusable data. This ensures that all models and analyses are based on the same set of features, improving reproducibility and efficiency. For example, the diabetes feature table can be directly used to train machine learning models to predict complications, while the comorbidity table can be used to assess the impact of comorbid conditions on health outcomes.

## 5 Reports: City Level Analysis Report 

### 5.1 Introduction
The built environment—the design and layout of urban spaces—has long been associated with public health outcomes. While factors like access to healthcare services, availability of recreational spaces, and urban design are important, the geographic location of individuals within a city can also influence their health. In particular, for individuals living with chronic diseases like diabetes, various factors such as access to healthcare, lifestyle, and local healthcare resources can contribute to the progression of complications.

In this report, we investigate the association between the number of diabetes complications and the city-level location of diabetic patients within Saudi Arabia, using a sample of medical claims records. By examining the geographic distribution of diabetes complications and integrating demographic information (age, sex), body measurements (BMI), and comorbidity data, we aim to explore whether living in certain cities correlates with different health outcomes for diabetic individuals.

*The objectives of this analysis are:*

- Investigate the relationship between city-level location and the frequency of diabetes complications.
- Analyze demographic and health-related factors, including age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities, to understand their role in diabetes complications at the city level.
- Provide insights that may inform healthcare interventions or policy changes aimed at improving diabetes management and reducing complications across cities.
Ultimately, this analysis seeks to identify any significant patterns that could inform public health strategies tailored to specific geographic regions.

*Hypothesis:*

There is a significant relationship between the `number of diabetes complications claims` and the `city` in which the patients reside. The analysis will explore whether certain cities experience higher rates of complications, potentially influenced by demographic factors like `age`, `sex`, `BMI`, and `comorbidities`.

### 5.2 Methodology

In the following section we demonstrate the steps for conducting the analysis, model building and validation.

***Data Extraction***
Using the feature store we extracted the `city_comp_df` which is a data sets the focuses on the demographic and calims summary at the individual level. The data sets containg the target variable of interest `number of diabetes reported diabetes complications` , the main explanatory vriable `city` and other important variables including `age`, `bmi`, `number of comorbiditeis`, `type of diabetes reported` and `total number of diabetes reported`:

- examine the relationship between outcome var and other explanatory var  [vs age, vs bmi, vs # comorbity, vs diabetes type, ]

- examine the relationship between explanatory var with each other and test for colinearity [age vs bmi, # comorbity  vs # complications, ag]



#### 5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis

Once the relevant data is retrieved from the feature store, the analysis proceeds with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which serves as a foundation for understanding the structure, distribution, and relationships within the dataset. The steps involved in EDA include:

##### 5.2.1 : Univariate Analysis
plot the  distribution of the numerical and categorical variables

##### 5.2.2 : Correlation Analysis
Visualise the correlation between numerical variables

##### 5.2.3 : Target vs Main Explanatory Variable

##### 5.2.4 : Target vs Secondary Explanatory Variable
##### 5.2.5 : Summary of EDA results

Summarizing key findings from this part—e.g., correlations between variables like BMI and diabetes complications—would provide a stronger foundation for your predictive modeling.
It would be beneficial to include the following:
- Distribution of critical variables (e.g., age, BMI, and Charlson comorbidity index).
- Correlation matrix showing relationships between key variables.
-  Any outliers or trends identified in the data.

#### 5.3 Modeling

***Modeling***
- Modeling - Hypothesis testing:
    - Choose the mode --> Test the hypothesis of an association between number of diabetes complications and city using a Poissons regression
        - Rational: we are modeling counts as the outcome
        - model assumptions:
          - outcome is count data
          - check for overdispersion
        - 
    -  Create several models:
        - Univariate model (only main explanatory variable)
        - main model (controlling for confounders)
        - full model (additional variables) 
        - Robust model (adding cluster variance)
        - *Suggestion: Include how you validate these models such as cross-validation or performanve metrics (AIC, BIC)*
    - Model Validation: Models will be validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness. Performance metrics such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) will be used to compare model fit and complexity. Additionally, metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R-squared will be used for regression models to assess predictive accuracy.

The methodology for this analysis begins with retrieving the necessary data from the feature store, which houses the engineered features required for our exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling. The feature store allows for efficient access to transformed data, ensuring consistency and facilitating reproducibility in our analysis.


##### 5.3.1 : Choosing Model
This section is critical because it explains why you chose a particular modeling technique over others. You might want to expand on:
- Rationale: Why Poisson regression? Was it due to the nature of the data (count data for diabetes complications)? Were there other methods considered (e.g., Negative Binomial, Logistic Regression for binary outcomes)?
- Assumptions: Discuss any assumptions the model makes. For Poisson regression, you can talk about the assumption of equal variance and mean. If those assumptions don't hold, you might need to discuss the need for a different model (e.g., Negative Binomial for overdispersed data).
- Model Selection Criteria: What was the key factor for selecting the model (predictive power, interpretability, handling of specific types of data, etc.)?

##### 5.3.2 : Comparing Models
This section should provide a comparison of multiple models, and the following points might be helpful:
- Baseline Model: Start with a simple baseline model (e.g., univariate regression with just one predictor). This will help you assess the improvement when adding more features.
- Additional Models: Compare the chosen model (Poisson regression) with alternatives like:
A simple linear regression (if the outcome were continuous),
Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with a different distribution (e.g., Negative Binomial),
Decision trees, Random Forests, or XGBoost if you want to show a machine learning approach.
- Model Metrics: Evaluate each model based on common performance metrics such as:
  - AIC/BIC (for model comparison),
  - Log-likelihood,
  - Deviance (for Poisson models),
  - RMSE, R-squared, or other appropriate metrics depending on the model type.
  - Cross-validation scores to ensure robustness of the model.

##### 5.3.3 : Results Summary
Summarize the key results of the modeling in this section:
- Key coefficients/variables: What variables were most influential in the model (e.g., BMI, age, comorbidities)?
- Model performance: How well did the model perform in terms of goodness of fit and predictive power? Show key statistics such as AIC, BIC, and deviance residuals.
- Model diagnostics: Were there any issues detected (e.g., residuals, goodness of fit, cross-validation results, outliers, multicollinearity)?

##### 5.3.4 : Findigs and Explainability of the model
Interpretability and Insights:
- Explainability is critical in healthcare data, so make sure to focus on the importance of key variables. For example, if BMI has a significant effect, explain what this means in the context of diabetes complications.
- If you're using Poisson regression, explain the coefficients (e.g., a one-unit increase in BMI leads to a certain increase in the expected count of complications).
- Use tools like SHAP values or LIME (if applicable for more complex models like decision trees) to explain feature importance.
- Impact of individual predictors: Provide real-world interpretation of how different factors affect the outcome (e.g., how does age or comorbidity score influence complications?).
  
##### 5.3.5 : Actionable Insights & Strategic Recommendations
Actionable Insights: Translate the findings into clear, actionable insights for decision-makers. For example:
- If age is a major factor in diabetes complications, healthcare providers may want to focus on preventive care for older populations.
- If cities with certain demographics are identified as higher risk, targeted interventions could be proposed.
Strategic Recommendations: Based on the insights, propose strategies for improving healthcare claims management or preventive measures for diabetes-related complications. Recommendations could include:
- Tailored interventions in high-risk areas.
- Improving data quality or feature collection (e.g., including additional demographic information).

**Emphasizing the Business Value: While you've done a good job focusing on technical aspects, be sure to tie back findings and recommendations to the business or healthcare outcomes.**

##### 5.3.6 : Discussion and Limitations
This section is crucial for reflecting on the analysis. You should address:
- Model Assumptions: Were any assumptions (e.g., for Poisson regression) violated, and how did you handle them? For example, if the Poisson model assumption of mean variance doesn’t hold, how did you adjust (e.g., switching to a Negative Binomial model)?
- Data Issues: Any potential data issues that could have influenced the model (e.g., missing data, measurement error)?
- External Factors: Are there any external factors that could affect the interpretation of the results, such as socioeconomic factors, healthcare system differences, or unmeasured variables?
- Model Limitations: Are there any limitations of the model that could affect its generalizability or applicability in real-world decision-making?

##### 5.3.5 : Next Steps
Further Analysis: What additional analyses could be conducted to build on this model? You could consider:
- Exploring interactions between features (e.g., age × BMI).
- Using more sophisticated models (e.g., Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) to predict diabetes complications with greater accuracy.
- Incorporating time-series data (if available) for longitudinal predictions.
Data Collection and Enhancements: Propose further data collection that could enhance the modeling process, such as more granular data on lifestyle factors, treatments, etc.
- Model Deployment: If the model is deemed reliable and useful, discuss potential deployment into real-world applications (e.g., integrating with healthcare systems for predicting claims).
  
##### 5.3.7 : Conclusion
The conclusion should summarize the key takeaways from the analysis:
- Restate the modeling approach and summarize which model worked best.
- Mention the key predictors that were most influential (age, BMI, etc.).
- Highlight the implications for healthcare decision-making or claims management.
